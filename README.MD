## Bluetooth-send

It's a simple app with just two buttons that part of a big IOT project
you can customize the UI as you want this is just a simple example it's job
to send a command from the android device to the microcontroller you
work in we will show an simple example with arduino

## Feature

* Apply material design
* Easy to use
* The code well documented and easy to understand
* Easy to integrate at any exciting project

## Use cases
The main usage for this after you done your customization in he UI
is to control a microcontroller example of this control a car, Prostheses ..etc.
The options and ideas is a lot

## Getting started
* If you want to use the project in it's state and customize it as your needs

The connection to Bluetooth device is already handled
only you need to use a method `sendData` and call it when you want to
send a data or action to the microcontroller it takes a string as input parameter
in this case the data that will be send and it's preferred to be character and
that's it :D

You also may need to change the application name you can do it
form the strings file and put your awesome app name
`<string name="app_name">BluetoothSend</string>`

* If you want to integrate this functionality to exciting project follow along
with these steps

1- Add the bluetooth permissions in the `manifest`
```
<!-- Bluetooth Permissions -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

2- Also in the `manifest` make the screen Orientation **the app right now
does not  handle the screen Orientation in the runtime**

`android:screenOrientation="portrait"`
or
`android:screenOrientation="landscape"`

3- Don't forget to add the design support dependency in `build.gradle`
>`compile 'com.android.support:design:25.3.1'`

4- Put the required resources files
* in the drawable , layout  and strings you will find them in this example

5- Create a Bluetooth devices activity that will help to find and connect
to bluetooth device [BluetoothDevices.java](https://github.com/Ahmed-Abdelmeged/Bluetooth-send/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/mego/bluetoothsend/BluetoothDevices.java)
[BluetoothDevices.xml](https://github.com/Ahmed-Abdelmeged/Bluetooth-send/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_bluetooth_devices.xml)


 6- Add the Bluetooth device adapter that handle show and display the devices
 in the Bluetooth Devices activity
This the adapter code [BluetoothDeviceAdapter.java](https://github.com/Ahmed-Abdelmeged/Bluetooth-send/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/mego/bluetoothsend/BluetoothDevicesAdapter.java)     
[BluetoothDeviceItem.xml](https://github.com/Ahmed-Abdelmeged/Bluetooth-send/blob/master/app/src/main/res/layout/item_device.xml)

7- Now the last step is to configure the activity that will handle sending and connecting to the microcontroller you can find the code for this logic in the [MainActivity.java](https://github.com/Ahmed-Abdelmeged/Bluetooth-send/blob/master/app/src/main/java/app/mego/bluetoothsend/MainActivity.java)  in `onResume()` you connect to the device and in
`onStop` you disconnect from the devices using the `Disconnect()`
method and the `ConnectBT ` AsyncTask to connect to the device
in background thread after the connection is success use the
`sendData` to communicate with the microcontroller

## Microcontroller

I use **Arduino** as simple example for test the code but it work for the other microcontrollers and this the Arduino code [BluetoothSendArduino.ino](https://github.com/Ahmed-Abdelmeged/Bluetooth-send/blob/master/BluetoothSendArduino/BluetoothSendArduino.ino)

## What's next?
* Make the app as simple library
* Add the receiving form the microcontroller functionality
